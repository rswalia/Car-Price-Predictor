## Overview
To be able to predict used cars market value can help both buyers and sellers. 
There are lots of individuals who are interested in the used car market at some points in their life because they wanted to sell their car or buy a used car. In this process, it’s a big corner to pay too much or sell less then it’s market value.

In this Project, we are going to predict the Price of Used Cars using various features like Present_Price, Selling_Price, Kms_Driven, Fuel_Type, Year etc. The data used in this project was downloaded from Kaggle.

## How does this project work?

1. First of all the data was scraped from Quikr.com (https://quikr.com) 
Link for dataset: https://github.com/rajtilakls2510/car_price_predictor/blob/master/quikr_car.csv

2. The data was cleaned and analysed.

3. Then a Linear Regression model was built on top of it.
